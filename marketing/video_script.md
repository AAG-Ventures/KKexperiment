# Video Script

I'll write every scene in two pieces: The narrator's monologue and what has to be shown visually.

The narrator should be man's voice (similar to Morgan Freeman maybe)

## First scene:

**The Narrator:** Your coworker is getting praised for everything that usually takes time and yet he does it in no time at all.

**Visual:** A coworker in a suit is shaking hands with boss and all of the colleagues in the background are clapping

## Second scene:

**The Narrator:** Your wife is also praising her best friend's husband because he spends so much time with her.

**Visual:** Wife is leaning with one arm on the kitchen table (husband's shoulder is shown as she is talking directly to him but we see only husband's back ((shoulder)) and in the cloud (thinking bubble) we see coworker and her best friend hugging with hearts in the air).

## Third scene:

**The Narrator:** He even spends more time with your kids than you do.

**Visual:** House in the background and in the garden we can see the wife and coworker playing with two kids. One kid is in a coworker's arms and the other kid has his hands up (as if he wants the coworker to pull him up, too). The wife (their mother) is smiling and has put her arms together near the chest (happy and excited).

## Fourth scene:

**The Narrator:** He has too much free time, so you decide to peep into his computer. That's when you find...

**Visual:** The husband (our guy) walks into a coworker's cubicle. Sits next to the desk. The computer is shown. On the screen is ME. M are on top of E and both letters are on the left side of the screen.

## Fifth scene:

**The Narrator:** Mind Extension -

**Visual:** On computer screen M and E extends into full words MInd Extension.

## Sixth scene:

**The Narrator:** AI that adapts to you—build, use, or control custom agents, no coding needed.

**Visual:** On computer screen: PERSONALIZED (and chatbox with a message "Hey, John")

## Seventh scene:

**The Narrator:** Notes, files, tasks & workflows—automated to turn your chaos into clarity.

**Visual:** On computer screen: AUTOMATED (below next after the other: task is checked v; mail is sent; file is closed)

## Eighth scene:

**The Narrator:** A marketplace for innovation—turn your ideas and agents into income.

**Visual:** On computer screen: PROFITABLE (below two people are shaking hands as they made a deal)

## Ninth scene:

**The Narrator:** In a world where AI tools multiply daily, one platform stands apart—evolving, learning, and protecting your vision. Your productivity shouldn't be scattered across dozens of apps. The future is inevitable. It's you. It's me.

**Visual:** Screen splits into multiple small windows showing different tools from ME. Then they all start flowing/merging into a single ME interface, symbolizing unification.

## Tenth scene:

**All-in-ME**
