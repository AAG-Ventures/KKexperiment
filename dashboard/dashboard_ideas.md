# Dashboard Ideas & Notes

Use this file to jot down all your thoughts, requirements, and important reminders for constructing the user dashboard. Add anything you don't want to forget!

---

## Things to Consider
- Key features and widgets for users
- User flows (onboarding, navigation, etc.)
- Integrations (APIs, notifications)
- Accessibility and responsive design
- Visual style and branding (see Figma)
- Data privacy and user controls
- Any pain points or inspiration from other dashboards

---

## Feature Ideas / Must-haves
1. Separate work from personal space (e.g. health, food)—user can create/update these spaces themselves
2. Active processes switcher with notifications when completed (processes on left side below knowledgebase)
3. History of each agent's thoughts and communication
   - Agent should be proactive: suggest insights and ask if some parts of the history are still relevant (notify the user if items are untouched for a long time)
4. Tools / Connections (Instagram, Gmail, Slack, etc.)
5. Automations
6. Knowledgebase—files and folders should be created automatically
   - Shared spaces should be manageable next to each knowledgebase item
7. Widgets:
   - My Tasks (top right corner)
   - File display (middle)
   - Customizable layout (e.g., rearrange/hide widgets)
8. Chatbox (bottom right corner)
   - Support "new tab" option to switch between different contexts/conversations
9. Create (+) button (bottom left)—opens popup to select what you want to add: folder, automation, custom agent, marketplace
   - When selecting "automation", show templates as part of the flow
10. Profile: includes settings (privacy), logout, and connect personal profiles/tools (Instagram, Facebook, etc.)
    - Dark/Light mode
    - Quick actions (e.g., command palette)
    - Notification center
11. Guided onboarding for new users
12. Analytics dashboard (usage stats, productivity insights, agent performance)
13. Export feature for created text, files, Google Docs, etc.
